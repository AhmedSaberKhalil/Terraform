I deployed a highly available web application architecture on AWS using Terraform. The VPC contains both public and private subnets, with an Internet Gateway providing external access through an Application Load Balancer. Incoming traffic is routed from the ALB to a Target Group containing multiple EC2 instances in private subnets, enabling secure and scalable load balancing. Security groups and routing rules isolate backend resources from the public internet, while Terraform automates full environment provisioning, making the infrastructure reproducible and easy to maintain.
